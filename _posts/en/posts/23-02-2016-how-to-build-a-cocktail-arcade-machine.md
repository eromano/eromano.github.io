title: How to Build a Cocktail Arcade Machine
---
Here we are, my blog officially opens today! Today, I have decided to share with you how I realized my arcade cocktail table. It all started with ​​my brother's idea. He saw some very nice online arcade tables but the cost was really excessive, so I said CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.. I'll do It by myself!
I went down in my Batcave and I started up my laptop and I made a 3DSMAX schema with the first prototype of the table.

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Joypad settings</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table1.jpg" alt="table arcade 3d project 1" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table2.jpg"  alt="table arcade 3d project 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>

After completing these two pieces of 3D contemporary art I wrongly thought that the project was completed but in fact, It was just the beginning, so I slept on It and the next day I went to a carpenter friend. Once we choose the wood and discussed the points to revise in the project, we started work immediately to build it

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Making of Table</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img  src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood-1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood-1.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>

At this point, It was necessary to decide how to arrange the buttons on the console. I was surprised to discover a huge selection of these types of configurations on internet :

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Buttons Schema</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/button-arcade-configuration.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/button-arcade-configuration.png" alt="foto configurazione bottoni" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

So We took a drill and we made these beautiful holes that you see below:

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Making of holes</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione buchi bottoni" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole2.jpg"  alt="table arcade realizzazione buchi bottoni 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

But after realizing the console it was necessary to create a mechanism that would keep open horizontally the console when we using as arcade and to be honest It was one of the most exhausting things to do, but in the end I succeeded!

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Console Mechanism</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-find-mechanism.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-find-mechanism.jpg" alt="ricerca meccanismo" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

Finally, We arrive at the electronics part (That's where it gets interesting) after  bought on Ebay a raspberry pi and a joypad arcade kit I started to work to the electronic. The assembly of all the parts didn’t require much time:

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Joypad settings</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-1.jpg" alt="configurazione joypad" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-2.jpg"  alt="configurazione joypad2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

For the configuration of the arcade raspberry, I opted for the installation of this http://piplay.org/ distribution.

Often as a developer is difficult to share with other people the pleasure of a finished project and It's for this reason that I often like to do analogic things. What add.. if you have any doubt or you need help, do not hesitate to contact me, I will be happy to help you in your self-build arcade cocktail table!
