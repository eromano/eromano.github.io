In the '90s' we thought that the Virtual reality was the last frontier but after a while, it's disappeared , nowadays the VR is back to stay . Many are the
  devices for sale on the market such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and many others will be soon released as PlayStation VR.
  Another way to experience the virtual reality without spending a fortune it’s using an headset compatible with your smartphone
  So the first step to realise my first 3D game was to buy a cheap 3D headset for mobile phones such as the one you see below.

    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/marble-boing/3D_Headset.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/marble-boing/3D_Headset.jpg" alt="3d headset" /></a>
        </article>
            <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">

            </article>
        </div>

Once I bought on eBay for just 15 £ my new 3D viewer, it was time to start making the game. After sleepless nights and several beers to increase my creativity level,
   I decided trivially to make a porting of an old game in VR. Marble Boing 3D which you can see some screenshots below,
     I decided to evolve it in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gem.marblevirtualvr"> Marble boing VR </a>.
     In short, not a 'stupendous undertaking but a simple porting to understand the basic concepts of VR . As usual "keep it simple!!".

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Marble boing</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/marble-boing/ScreenshotGame0.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/marble-boing/ScreenshotGame0.png" alt="screenshot old 1" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/marble-boing/ScreenshotGame1.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/marble-boing/ScreenshotGame1.png" alt="screenshot old 2 " /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

To realize Marble boing VR I used <a href="https://unity3d.com/"> Unity </a> a quite famous game engine that you can use to make games in C # or JavaScript.
  If you want to learn how to use it you can find here some <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn"> interesting tutorial </a>.
  If like me you already are familiar with this game engine you could find the following snippets relative a VR Game interesting:

* Google VR SDK for Unity <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/"> here </a>
* Auto Walk script <a href="https://github.com/JuppOtto/Google-Cardboard/blob/master/Autowalk.cs"> here </a>

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Cardboard</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/marble-boing/unity.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/marble-boing/unity.jpg" alt="unity" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/marble-boing/cardBoard.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/marble-boing/cardBoard.png" alt="Cardboard" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

At this point, I was armed with glue and duct tape plus a dash of inventiveness and I realized my first VR game from which I learned many new things as:

* The movement of the gamer's head must be consistent with that in the 3D world to not cause nausea (Vestibular mismatch).
* There are not many users currently interested in this kind of app.
* It 'hard to find advertising systems compatible with the VR game then, in turn, it is complicated to make the game profitable.


Unfortunately, at the time the game does not have many downloads and perhaps the pay to play formula will is not helping.
