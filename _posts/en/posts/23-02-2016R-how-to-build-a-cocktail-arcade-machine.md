title: How to Build a Cocktail Arcade Machine
---
Here we are, with this first article officially opens my blog! Today I decided to share with you how I realized my arcade cocktail table. It all started with ​​my brother idea He saw some very nice online arcade tables but the cost was really outrageous, so I said CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.. I do it by myself!
I went down in my Batcave and I started my laptop and I made a 3DSMAX schema with the first prototype of the table.

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Progettazione 3D tavolino</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table1.jpg" alt="table arcade 3d project 1" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/3d-project-arcade-table2.jpg"  alt="table arcade 3d project 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>

After these two pieces of 3D contemporary art in my mind was almost finished, so I slept on and the next day I went to a carpenter friend. Once we choose the wood and discussed the points to revise in the project, we started work immediately to build it

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Realizzazione tavolino</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img  src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood-1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-wood-1.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione 2" /></a>
        </article>

Now the Arcade Table starts to take a shape but It was just the beginning. At this point It was necessary to decide how to arrange the buttons on the console, I was surprised to discover on the internet a huge selection of these types of configuration:

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Schema configurazione</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/button-arcade-configuration.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/button-arcade-configuration.png" alt="foto configurazione bottoni" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

So We took a drill and we made these beautiful holes that you see below:

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Realizzazione buchi</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole.jpg" alt="table arcade realizzazione buchi bottoni" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-buttons-hole2.jpg"  alt="table arcade realizzazione buchi bottoni 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

But after realizing the console it was necessary to create a mechanism that would keep open horizontally the console when we using as arcade, and, to be honest, it was one of the most exhausting things to do, but in the end I succeeded!

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Meccanismo console</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-find-mechanism.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-find-mechanism.jpg" alt="ricerca meccanismo" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

Finally, we arrive at the electronics part (and gets more fun for me) after  bought on Ebay a raspberry pi and a joypad arcade kit I started to work. The assembly of all didn’t require much time:

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Configurazione Joypad</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-1.jpg" alt="configurazione joypad" /></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/Joypad-mount-2.jpg"  alt="configurazione joypad2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>

For the configuration of the arcade raspberry, I opted for the installation of this http://piplay.org/ distribution.

<div id="gallery">
    <h2>Tavolino finito</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-end1.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-end1.jpg" alt="arcade table end 1"/></a>
        </article>
        <article class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
            <a href="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-end2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/table-arcade/table-arcade-end2.jpg"  alt="arcade table end 2" /></a>
        </article>
    </div>

Often as a developer is difficult to share with other people the pleasure of a finished project and it is for this reason that I often like to do analogic things.
