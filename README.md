# [Eugenio Romano Blog](http://eromano.github.io/)

I love to work in Team . I have a positive attitude for any circumstances and  accept challenges of both profession and life.
I like to be updated in my field and as well as good knowledge of other fields.
I found the passion that gives sense to work in this field. My main interest is to Create and Design quality software.
